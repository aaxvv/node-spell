# Node Spell

A Minecraft 1.19.3 mod adding a magic system that uses node based programming similar to unreal blueprints

I finished the entire programming system and added most of the nodes I wanted.  
But after finishing "the hard part", I lost interest in doing the actual game-design to integrate it into survival gameplay.  
So while the programming system is almost feature complete, the mod has no real gameplay to it.

## Features
- Fully node-based programming UI for defining spells
- Extensive node library for math, logic, control flow, etc.
- Sub-Graph system for reusable subroutines
